A functional 2D plane geometry and dynamics library for spatial 2D and 3D applications. Designed especially for scaleable and rotatable [affine geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_space) where parallel 2D planes float in 3D space and undergo [perspective projections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_projection) and [basis changes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_of_basis). Written in JavaScript (ECMAScript 6) with a functional, immutable, class-free style.

## Using data structures and functions

Instead of classes, affineplane functions operate on plain objects. The available functions are pure, in a sense that they never modify the input, do not cause side effects, have no hidden state, and they always return new objects computed from the input. For example:

    const aff = require('affineplane')
    const point = aff.point2.create(2, 5)
    const po = aff.point2.offset(point, 3, 0)
    // po equals { x: 5, y: 5 }

The functions are grouped in *namespaces*, each focusing on a certain geometry. A common theme of the lib is to explicitly distinguish static shapes from their dynamic movements, like [point2](docs/API.md#affineplanepoint2) from [vec2](docs/API.md#affineplanevec2) because they behave differently. For example, while a point has a location in space, a vector does not. On the other hand, two vectors can be added together but the same cannot be done for two points. Thus it is best to keep the concepts separate. For details on the topic and its foundations, see [Difference between points and vectors](docs/FOOTNOTES.md#difference-between-points-and-vectors).

## Transitions and change of basis

In affineplane, we distinguish geometry, say a point, from its representation, like `{x,y}`. While the representation depends on the frame of reference, like a plane origin, the geometry itself does not. To illustrate this, the image below shows how the same point has different coordinates depending on which plane to choose for the reference.

![Projection between planes for a point](docs/projection-between-planes-point-2d.png)

We cannot represent geometry without a frame of reference. However, we can _transit_ it from one reference basis to another. In the case of affineplane, the reference is a 2D plane. A point `{x,y}` is a point on the plane at coordinates (x,y). To transit the point to another plane, we can use [point2.transitTo](docs/API.md#affineplaneplane2transitto) function.

    // Create a point and a plane, both relative to a reference plane.
    const p = { x: 4, y: 2 }
    const plane = aff.plane2.fromFeatures({
      origin: { x: 1, y: 0 }
    })
    // Represent the point on the plane.
    const pp = aff.point2.transitTo(p, plane)
    // pp equals { x: 3, y: 2 }
    // Transit back to original reference plane
    const ppp = aff.point2.transitFrom(pp, plane)
    // ppp equals { x: 4, y: 2 }

In affineplane, we define a plane using Helmert transformation `{a,b,x,y}`. Such transformation can represent uniform scaling, rotation around z-axis, and translation along x- and y-axis. The transformation here acts as the [passive transit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_and_passive_transformation) from the plane coordinates back to its reference plane coordinates. It does not change the geometry, only the frame of reference.

Effectively, the `x,y` part defines the position of the plane origin with respect to the reference origin. The `a,b` part defines the plane basis vectors, giving the scale and angle, in terms of the reference basis. See the illustration below for an example.

(image of a plane here)

The following snippet transits a vector from a source plane to the reference plane by using [point2.transitFrom](docs/API.md#affineplaneplane2transitfrom). The source has scale of 2, angle of +90 degrees, and 100 units of translation along x-axis. Let us see how it affects the vector:

    const v = { x: 5, y: 2 }
    const plane = { a: 0, b: 2, x: 100, y: 0 }
    const vv = aff.vec2.transitFrom(v, plane)
    // vv equals { x: -4, y: 10 }

Due to the scale, one unit of length on the plane is equal to two units on the reference plane. Therefore the coordinate numbers double. Due to the plane angle, the coordinate directions rotate. The translation of 100 units did not affect the coordinates, however, because unlike points, vectors have only length and direction, thus nothing to translate.

Also note that while the coordinates changed, the vector in question did not. It is still the same vector, only represented in a different frame of reference. In the illustration below you can see that regardless of where you place the vector **v**, its components stay the same.

![Projection between planes for a vector](docs/projection-between-planes-vector-2d.png)

Transitions never lose information and therefore can be done in both directions. Next we discuss projections that do not have this property.

## Projections

A projection maps geometry from a source plane to an image plane. Unlike transitions, projections may lose information and therefore can be performed only in one direction. For example when you project a 3D point onto a 2D surface, information is lost and you cannot project the point back because you do not know the distance.

Affineplane provides orthogonal and perspective projections between parallel planes. Perspective projections require you to specify a camera location. Orthogonal projections do not require camera but can be thought as perspective projections with camera at infinity. The following snippet gives examples of both orthogonal and perspective projections.

    const p = { x: 4, y: 2, z: 4 }
    const image = { a: 1, b: 0, x: 0, y: 0, z: 2 }
    const portho = aff.point2.projectTo(p, image)
    // portho equals { x: 4, y: 2 }
    const camera = {Â x: 0, y: 0, z: 0 }
    const ppersp = aff.point2.projectTo(p, image, camera)
    // ppersp equals { x: 2, y: 1 }

In the snippet above, the image plane to project to is otherwise equivalent to the reference plane but two units off along z-axis. The depth offset does not affect the result orthogonal projection which is the same point but missing the z dimension. With perspective projection and camera at z=0, however, the point moves towards the camera.

Note that in affineplane the camera always points towards positive z-axis and is orthogonal to the reference plane. In other words the positive z-axis points away from the viewer.

Vectors and other movements can only be projected orthogonally. This is because perspective projection would require them to have known positions relative to the camera.

## Type safety

Affineplane is very loose on types and requires you to ensure you feed the functions what they minimally expect. This has a benefit: you can input objects that have extra properties; only the properties affineplane understands are used. For example `{ color: 'ff00ff', x: 2, y: 3 }` is a valid affineplane point2.

To check validity of an object, each geometry type has `validate` function. We could have included validity checking into each function but that would have caused excess of checking for this kind of low-level math functions. Instead, use `validate` when you need it.

We might have TypeScript bindings in the future.
