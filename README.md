## Geometry

Shapes:

- [dir2](docs/API.md#affineplanedir2), direction on a plane, `number` in rad
- [dist2](docs/API.md#affineplanedist2), distance between two locations on a plane, `number`
- [point2](docs/API.md#affineplanepoint2), a location on a plane, `{x,y}`
- [point3](docs/API.md#affineplanepoint3), a location in a 3D space, `{x,y,z}`
- [size2](docs/API.md#affineplanesize2), a rectangle size on a plane, `{w,h}`

Movements:

- [linear2](docs/API.md#affineplanelinear2), a linear transformation on a plane, `{a,b}`
- [tran2](docs/API.md#affineplanetran2), an affine transformation on a plane, `{a,b,x,y}`
- [vector2](docs/API.md#affineplanevector2), a displacement on a plane, `{x,y}`
- [vector3](docs/API.md#affineplanevector2), a displacement in a 3D space, `{x,y,z}`

Projections:

- [proj2](docs/API.md#affineplaneproj2), projection between similar planes, `{a,b,x,y}`
- [proj3](docs/API.md#affineplaneproj3), perspective projection between parallel planes, `{a,b,x,y,z}`

## Using data structures and functions

Instead of classes, affineplane provides functions that operate on plain objects. The available functions are pure, in a sense that they never modify the input, do not cause side effects, have no hidden state, and they always return new objects computed from the input.

The functions are grouped in *namespaces*, each focusing on a certain geometry. A common theme of the lib is to explicitly distinguish static shapes from their dynamic movements. Otherwise, in our experience, it is all too easy to mix these concepts in the code which can break the math as described below.

## Difference between points and vectors

Affine planes have *no origin* by default. The point (0,0) on an affine plane is not an origin. This has interesting consequences that separates the often analogous concepts of the point and the vector.

Let A and B be points on an affine plane. As illustrated below, the result of their addition A + B is arbitrary and fully depends on the choice of the reference point, the origin. The situation might sound exotic but it is rather commonplace. For example, choose any two items nearby and try add their locations together. The result does not make sense, does it? Our physical world is essentially a space without a fixed origin.

In contrast, the *distance* between points A and B remains constant regardless the choice of origin. Also their difference A - B and mean C have this origin-invariant property. For the two items you chose, although you could not sum their locations, there still is a distance between the items and you can find a location at the middle.

On the other hand, *vectors* represent movement and displacement on the plane. It is easy to imagine adding two moves together to produce a larger move. Therefore, a vector can be added to another vector to produce a third vector â€“ their sum. Also, a vector can be added to a point to produce another point. The same vector can be added to other points as well. Therefore it is apparent that vectors do not have specific location on the plane but instead represent dynamic movements of shapes and can be applied anywhere on the plane.

There is another way to understand why points on an affine plane behave such a way. Think of a plane in 3D space so that the plane is lifted away from the space origin, as illustrated below. Now, the points A,B on the plane can be described as 3D vectors from the space origin O to the points, denoted as OA and OB. As you can see, addition of two such vectors OA + OB yields a result that does not stay on the plane. Their difference OA - OB is a vector parallel to the plane and the distance between the points is the length of that vector. Does the mean of the two vectors stay on the plane?
